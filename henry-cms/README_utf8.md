### Theming

Themes are located in the `/theme` folder and the main template file is the `Ã¬ndex.html` file.
Variables are placed using the double curly bracket syntax `{{ $variable_name }}` i.e: in order to print the page title you'll use the `{{ $HERNYO['page']['title'] }}` code in the template.

#### Variables

The elements to be used when theming your website using Hernyo CMS are encapsulated in an array called `$HERNYO`, and has the following variables :

- `$HERNYO['site']` :
	- `['site_language']` ISO 639-1 Language Code has the two letter identifier like: *EN*, *ES*, *FR* ...
	- `['site_title']` : Returns the **Site Title**.
    - `['site_description']` : mainly for seo purposes
    - `['site_keywords']` : same as above.
	- `['path]` : base directory ( `dirname($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'])` )
	- `['url]` : url where the website resides ( `HTTP_HOST + path` )

- `$HERNYO['pages']` : Variable contains all the data of every page in case you want to loop over it. Each page contains the following properties described below in the `$_PAGE` variable.

- `$HERNYO['page']` :
	- `['title']` The page title
    - `['description']` Short description of the page
    - `['content']` This is stored as Markdown but it returns the parsed HTML code of the page content
	- `['tags']` Comma separated tag values
	- `['datetime']` human-readable date/time in the form : `1914-12-20 08:30:45`
	- `['timedate']` Verbose time-date returned by default in the form (i.e) : *Thursday 12th of February 2009 @ 04:25 AM* `( Date: l jS \of F Y @ h:i A )`
	- `['link']` Returns the full url friendly link of the page in case `mod_rewite` exists on the Apache modules or the link with a url get variable in case it doesn't `?p=url-slug`
	- `['slug']` the slug defined on the admin area.

- `$HERNYO['is_page']` : Boolean returns if it is a page or not ( *Useful to filter the index/home page* )
- `$HERNYO['menu']` : Retuns an HTML unordered list with all the active pages linked to it. With an active class on the current element ( `class="active"` )
- `$HERNYO['prev_page']` full url friendly link to the previous page if exists, otherwise will return a link to the site url.
- `$HERNYO['next_page']` full url friendly link to the next page if exists, otherwise will return a link to the site url.
- `$HERNYO['is_404']` : Boolean returning if the page is a 404 not found file.

#### Adding extra variables

On the `config.php` file, you can add more `'key' => 'value'` items to the returned array to access them later on. 
 They will be encapsulated in the parent array `$HERNYO['site']`

For example, adding the following to the config array : `'my_var' => 'my_value'`

    <?php return array (
      'user' => 'username',
      'pass' => 'password' //"password" is replaced with the hash,
      'db' => 'data.dat',
      'site_language' => 'en',
      ...
      'files_folder' => '../files',
      'my_var' => 'my_value',
    );


You can later call it by using the bracket syntax : `{{ $HERNYO['site']['my_var'] }}`
